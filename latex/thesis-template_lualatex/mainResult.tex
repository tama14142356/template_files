Same as \cref{ch:method}, you must control the level of detail of the description.
It is highly recommended to explain an overview of the experiments.

\par
Each section must contain only one experiment, otherwise your sections may fail to tell readers wrong messages.
Each experiment must clarify the following components.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item purpose
	\item procedure accomplishing the purpose
	\item results obtained by performing the procedure
	\item consideration by comparing the expected results and the obtained results
\end{enumerate}
